There's a Javanese word that doesn't translate.

_Tlaten._ It means patience — but not the kind where you wait for something. It's the patience of doing, not waiting. Of repeating an action until the action teaches you something you couldn't learn by thinking. Sabar is sitting still. Tlaten is filing the same curve of silver for the fourth time because the third time was good enough for everyone except you.

Bapak uses this word. Not often — he's not a man who explains himself — but it comes out in specific moments. When he holds a finished piece up to the window and the light catches something wrong. When I rush through something and he watches without commenting, then later says: "Sing penting tlaten, nduk." That's it. No lecture. Just the word, delivered like a verdict.

His workshop is in the back of the house. You walk past the kitchen, past the clothesline, through a door that doesn't close properly, and you're in a different world. Concrete floor, zinc roof, one fluorescent tube that buzzes. The air smells like solder and metal dust. Tools hang from nails in the wall — pliers, files, hammers of different weights — each one placed where his hand expects it to be.

He makes silver filigree. The craft Kotagede has been known for since the Mataram Sultanate. Thin silver wire, twisted and soldered into patterns so fine they look like lace. A brooch might take three days. A box can take a week. There is no shortcut. There is no "close enough."

I used to sit on the floor and watch. Not because I was interested in silver — I was maybe seven, I was interested in the fact that a person could sit still for that long and not be bored. He'd pick up a piece, examine it, file it, put it down, pick it up again. Hours. The same piece. The same curve. Over and over until I couldn't see what he was fixing anymore.

I asked once: "Udah bagus kok, Pak."

He didn't look up. "Kamu ngerti bedanya?"

"Nggak."

"Nah. Sing beli juga nggak. Tapi aku ngerti."

I don't make silver. I write code. But I do the same thing.

A function passes all tests. The build is green. The PR is approved. And I stare at it for twenty minutes because something is wrong. Not wrong in a way that breaks anything — wrong in a way that only I can feel. An indentation inconsistency three levels deep. A variable name that's technically correct but misleading. An abstraction that works but doesn't explain itself.

Nobody would notice. I notice. And I fix it, knowing nobody will notice.

This used to bother me. It felt inefficient — why spend time on things that don't change the outcome? But the outcome isn't the output. The outcome is the practice. Every unnecessary fix is a repetition, and every repetition calibrates the eye. Bapak wasn't filing that curve for the customer. He was filing it for the skill of filing it.

There's a word for the person who does this with code: perfectionist. It's usually a criticism. In a silversmith's workshop in Kotagede, it's just how you work. The question isn't "is this good enough?" The question is "do you still see something wrong?"

If yes: again.

The sound of his workshop is the sound of tlaten. Small hammer on silver. File on edge. The occasional "wah" when something lands.

My room sounds different. Mechanical keyboard. Fan hum. The occasional "akhirnya" when a deployment works.

Same energy. Different frequency.

He knows I don't make silver. He's proud anyway — in the way Javanese fathers are proud, which is to say: he doesn't say it, but he built a shelf for my laptop charger in the workshop, next to his tools. Like it belongs there.

It does.

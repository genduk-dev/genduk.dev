The kentongan wakes you first.

Not your alarm, not your phone — the kentongan. A bamboo slit-drum, carried by the ronda guys through the gang-gang of Kotagede at 2:30 AM, banged in a rhythm that hasn't changed since before anyone alive can remember. They yell "sahur... sahur..." in a half-asleep drone, their voices bouncing off the narrow alley walls, fading into the next gang before you've fully opened your eyes.

It's the most Javanese alarm clock possible. No snooze button. No gentle escalation. Just wood on wood, a man's voice in the dark, and the knowledge that you have about an hour before you stop eating.

Then the wajan.

Emak is already up. You know because you hear it — metal on metal, the scrape of the spatula, then the smell of garlic hitting hot oil. That sound IS Ramadan mornings. Forget the theological explanations, the spiritual framework. Ramadan starts, for me, with the sound of my mother cooking in a kitchen lit by a single yellow bulb at 3 AM.

Nasi goreng is the classic sahur. Simple, fast, filling. But Emak rotates: bubur ayam if there's leftover chicken. Soto if she bought the spice paste yesterday. Lontong sayur if she's lazy, which she calls "menu anak kos" like she didn't raise a perfectly capable adult. Sometimes she pulls out last night's gudeg and reheats it, and that's honestly the best option because gudeg at 3 AM hits different from gudeg at any other hour.

Bapak is somehow already in the workshop. He claims he was "just checking something." At three in the morning. In his workshop. Where silver tools happen to be. He's not checking anything — he's been awake since 2:45 because he's the kind of man who brews kopi hitam before the kentongan even starts. No sugar, no milk, no discussion. He drinks it while reading something on his phone (probably the news, probably silently disagreeing with all of it), and by the time sahur is served, his cup is already empty.

I take the leftovers from his pot. I've been doing this since I was 14. He pretends not to notice.

The kitchen at sahur is the warmest room in the house. Not because of the stove — although that helps — but because it's the only time all three of us are in the same place without anyone needing to be somewhere else. No workshop, no warung, no laptop. Just spoons on plates and the rice cooker steaming and Emak muttering about something the neighbor said yesterday.

We don't really talk. Not in the "family bonding over breakfast" way you see in Ramadan commercials. More like: we exist together. Bapak eats efficiently. Emak refills things you didn't ask to be refilled. I eat whatever she plated and drink stolen kopi and try not to fall asleep into my rice.

The distant kentongan fades into the next gang over. Someone's rooster thinks it's morning already (it's not, it's just confused, same as every year). The call to subuh hasn't come yet but Emak is already watching the clock. She always stops eating five minutes before imsak. "Biar aman," she says, like those five minutes are the difference between accepted and rejected. Maybe they are. I don't question it.

What I want to say about sahur is that it's unremarkable.

That's the whole point. It's unremarkable in the way that only things repeated for decades can be. The same kitchen, the same wajan, the same man drinking the same unsweetened coffee at the same impossible hour. The same woman cooking the same rotation of food with the same complaints about the same neighbors. The same me, stumbling in at 3:30, taking the same seat, eating the same plate.

And yet every year, during the eleven months when there's no kentongan and no 3 AM kitchen and no stolen kopi from Bapak's pot, I miss it. Not the fasting part — nobody misses being hungry at 2 PM. I miss the routine. The specific texture of being half-asleep in a warm room with people who don't need you to be awake to want you there.

Kotagede is a kampung tua. Silver workshops, narrow alleys, old Javanese houses with thick walls that keep the heat out and the sounds in. During Ramadan, the kampung has its own clock — kentongan at 2:30, kitchen sounds at 3, subuh at the mushola at 4:33, the neighborhood going quiet by 5 as everyone surrenders to the day's fast. By noon, even the cats move slowly. By asar, the gang-gang smell like kolak and gorengan from every house preparing for buka.

This is not a cosmopolitan Ramadan. There's no fancy iftar buffet. No Instagram-worthy setup. Buka puasa is Emak's kolak pisang and whatever else she felt like making, eaten at the warung with the neighbors, and that's enough. Tarawih is at Masjid Agung Kotagede — the big one near the old royal cemetery — and the walk there is ten minutes through alleys that go quiet after maghrib.

It's almost 3 AM now. In about thirty minutes, I'll shuffle to the kitchen. Emak will already be there, and the wajan will already be going. Bapak's kopi pot will be half-empty. We'll eat in near-silence. Then subuh, then sleep, then the day stretches out into the familiar rhythm of not-eating and waiting.

But right now, in the quiet before the kitchen starts, Kotagede is perfectly still. No hammering from the workshops, no warung noise, no motorcycle engines in the gang. Just the distant last round of the kentongan and the roosters who haven't figured out the schedule.

This is the hour I like best. The one before the routine begins. The one where the only sound is the night doing nothing.

Selamat sahur.
